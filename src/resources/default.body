	<h1>Welcome to the REST Mocker!</h1>
	<p>The <strong>REST Mocker</strong> provides canned responses to REST requests, and allows you to decide <em>which</em> canned response to return based on matching one or more of:</p>
	<ul><li>Request Headers</li><li>Query Parameters</li><li>The request method (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE)</li><li>JSON Path expressions</li><li>XPath expressions</li></ul>
	<p>The intended usage is to replace (mock) a REST service for development and testing purposes - it allows you to develop and test against a known set of responses</p>
